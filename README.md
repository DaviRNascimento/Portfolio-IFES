# Portfolio-IFES
A portfolio with the purpose of show my skills!

Here I started developing using HTML and CSS. There are some files and activities where I could use more advanced CSS and HTML concepts, and you can see it here.
There is another directory where I used Bootstreap, instead of only use CSS selectors in a new file. I've learned how to love front-end and of course i'll improve my habilities studying more and more.

My name is Davi and I'm a Computer Science student in Vitoria, the Espirito Santo Capital, in Brazil. Nowadays I'm in the second period and learning Java with my college teachers and JavaScript by myself. I intend to learn Typescript too, cause I don't like the idea of work with non-typed data haha.
